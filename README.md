## Lessons learned & challenges
With this project, I was able to practice using variables, lists, dictionaries, and terminal styling in Python.

## How to use
The best way to use these games is by forking or downloading the files in this project. Please ensure that you have Python installed on your PC.

At this moment, the repository has 3 simple games:
1. **duvidas.py** â€” A game based on "Magic 8-Ball," in which the player thinks of a question, and then the program returns a random answer.
2. **perguntas_respotas.py** â€” This game involves defining a theme (which can be changed on the 'tema' variable) and allows the program to return a random question. Players take turns answering the questions for each other.
3. **vs_jogos.py** â€” It reads game names from the "vs_jogos.txt" file. The program will choose a random criteria and ask the player which of the two displayed games they like best based on that criteria. The chosen game stays, and the other is replaced by a new game. This continues until only one game remains, which becomes the winner of that criteria.
